# Volunteer for the Accessibility Forum

We love to work with the scientific community and have a few volunteer opportunities open for the Accessibility Forum.

[Sign up to be a volunteer](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9WtrvBmiRG5DmB0){class="button-reg"}

## Opportunities
- Volunteer as a live note taker for an event. This work is really appreciated by audiences and helps everyone catch up on anything they missed. Forum sessions are about 1.5 hours long and we ideally want several volunteers for each session so nobody gets tired.
- Provide caption translation from Spanish or Portuguese to English. This opportunity supports the SciELO session and is only open to fluent Spanish or Portuguese speakers. The captioning work will take place after the event in late September or November.
- Make a donation to support accessibility accommodations at the Forum.
- Or do you have something else in mind? We'd love to hear.

## Sign up to Volunteer

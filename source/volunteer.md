We love to work with the scientific community and have a few volunteer opportunities open for the Accessibility Forum.

## Opportunities
- Volunteer as a live note taker for an event. This work is really appreciated by audiences and helps everyone catch up on anything they missed. Forum sessions are about 1.5 hours long so we ideally would love to have two volunteers for each who can trade off.
- Provide caption translation from Spanish or Portuguese to English. This opportunity supports the SciELO session and is only open to fluent Spanish or Portuguese speakers. The captioning work will take place after the event in late September or November.
- Make a donation to support accessibility accommodations at the Forum.
- Or do you have something else in mind? We'd love to hear.

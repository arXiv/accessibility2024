#HTML Papers On arXiv: A Peek Under The Hood With LaTeXML And NVDA

![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-forum-logo-full-2024.svg){.mkd-img-right .mkd-spacing alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}

Join four open-source software luminaries to take a peek under the hood of how HTML papers on arXiv are made, what is working, and what comes next. Adding HTML to arXiv was only possible due to the efforts of so many people and organizations whose long-standing commitments to accessibility infrastructure and open-source software go back decades: screen readers, LaTeX converters, and TeX itself. They laid the foundations for this impactful and popular feature, and experts from each field are here to share their knowledge. Bring your questions and come ready to engage, be inspired, and gain a deeper understanding of what really makes a more accessible research paper.

Join us for this double celebration of accessibility gains and open-source software!

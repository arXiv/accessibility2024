#HTML Papers On arXiv: A peek under the hood with LaTeXML and NVDA

![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-forum-logo-full-2024.svg){.mkd-img-right .mkd-spacing alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}

Adding HTML to arXiv was possible because of organizations whose long-standing commitments to accessibility and open-source software go back decades. Join four open-source software luminaries from the NVDA screenreader, the LaTeXML converter, and arXiv to take a peek under the hood of how HTML papers on arXiv are made, what is working well, and where there is room for improvement. Learn more about this impactful and popular feature with true experts from the realms of TeX, screen readers, HTML, and web standards.

**Join us for this double celebration of accessibility gains and open-source software!** Bring your questions and gain a deeper understanding of what really makes a more accessible research paper.

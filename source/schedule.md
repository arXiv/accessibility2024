# Event schedule 
## Introduction

The Accessibility Forum, hosted by arXiv, is a remote event free and open to all.

Not one, not two, not three, but *seven* individual events will be held over the first two weeks in September addressing accessibility in the sciences. Learn from and celebrate the many people and organizations who are moving accessibility forward in academia.

Join a diverse lineup of scientists from around the world for presentations, Q&A, and dialogues on fascinating topics and new research. Exact dates and times are coming soon. <a href="https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eEZ1d27LF2fVM7Y" target="_blank">Register now</a> to stay up to date with Forum news as events are finalized (we promise our emails will be infrequent, short, and to the point).

# Accessible accommodations at the Forum

![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-forum-logo-full-2024.svg){.mkd-img-right .mkd-spacing alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}
We want the accessibility forum to be as accessible as welcoming as possible for the global scientific community. Guided by researchers with disabilities and the requests and feedback from forum participants last year, we will offer the following accommodations during all events:

## Language interpretation
We will have American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at all live events with one exception: as of now, our multilingual event with SciELO will feature simultaneous translation in Spanish and Portuguese only. (Do you know Sign Language interpreters who can translate from *both* spoken Spanish and Portuguese into Portuguese Sign Language *or* Spanish Sign Language? We would love to [connect](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWzTnoqv2Mn9Niu))

## Accessible video captions
All video recordings will have accessible, human-written captions (AI-generated captions cannot handle STEM content. You should see what zoom transcripts do with the words LaTeX and arXiv!)

## Live note-taking
Kind volunteers last year offered to take live notes in publicly available documents as a secondary way of following and checking back on discussions. We are [seeking volunteers](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWzTnoqv2Mn9Niu) for this year too. Let us know if you can donate an hour or so to an event. It is fun and very helpful.

## Modeling best practices
Our presenters this year want to seize the opportunity of modeling less well known best practices during the events. These include:

- Sharing as much content as we can in advance.
- Taking the time to communication clearly, with pauses and breaks for catching up, and normalizing moments of quiet absorption.
- Describing any visuals shared on screen.
- Allowing time for guests who speak ASL (a visual language) to absorb other visual content without both signals competing.
- Remaining flexible and adjusting to needs as they are shared during events.
- Live Zoom chat will not be enabled during events as it is highly disruptive to screen reader users. Instead, we encourage you to use the [discussion boards](discussion-board.html) that will be active on each event page.  

## Seeking CART captioning
We are investigating the feasibility of providing CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) captions at the live Forum events. If you or your organization provides this service, or would like to underwrite CART captions for the Forum, we would love to [hear from you](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWzTnoqv2Mn9Niu).

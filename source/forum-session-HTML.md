#HTML Papers On arXiv: A peek under the hood with LaTeXML and NVDA

<div class="lead">
  <div class="content">
    <p>arXiv added HTML as a paper format in December 2023. This impactful change was only possible because of organizations whose long-standing commitments to accessibility and open-source software go back decades. Join four open-source software luminaries from the NVDA screenreader, the LaTeXML converter, and arXiv to take a peek under the hood of how HTML papers on arXiv are made, what is working well, and where there is room for improvement.</p>

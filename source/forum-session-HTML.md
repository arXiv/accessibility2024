#HTML Papers On arXiv: A peek under the hood with LaTeXML and NVDA

<div class="lead">
  <div class="content">
    <p>Adding HTML to arXiv was possible because of organizations whose long-standing commitments to accessibility and open-source software go back decades. Join four open-source software luminaries from the NVDA screenreader, the LaTeXML converter, and arXiv to take a peek under the hood of how HTML papers on arXiv are made, what is working well, and where there is room for improvement. Learn more about this impactful and popular feature with experts from the realms of TeX, screen readers, HTML, and web standards.</p>

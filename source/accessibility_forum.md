## A practical forum, free and open to all
Hosted by arXiv, this half-day online forum will center the experiences of academic researchers with disabilities who face barriers to accessing and reading papers. The forum will be useful for people across the academic authoring and publishing ecosystem who are committed to making accessible research papers a reality. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.

We will walk away from this forum having learned three things:

1. That accessibility is a known problem with known solutions.
1. That we are far behind.
1. And that we can do it! Accessible research papers is a goal within reach. There are a lot of resources and smart people working on solutions. And those solutions can be relatively easy.

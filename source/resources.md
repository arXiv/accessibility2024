Find additional resources from our presenters, panelists, and other key participants, as well as researchers who want to share especially relevant papers. Go to the [discussion panel](#discussion) at the bottom to comment or leave questions about these resources.

## Resources
- arXiv's research into the accessibility of our own hosted content led to this [report](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_research_report.html) entitled "A framework for improving the accessibility of research papers on arXiv.org." What we learned from the many researchers and experts who shared their insights with us also led to this forum.

## Discussion
Use this discussion board to comment and ask questions about the resources above, or to share your relevant research. Can't comment? See [instructions](getting-started.md) for logging in with github.

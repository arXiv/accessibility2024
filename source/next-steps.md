This is a space to share what each participant sees as the most crucial next step towards making accessible research papers a reality. We hope the scientific community will consider which steps are right for you, or add your own efforts. We all have a role to play in making research accessible to all. Though not easy, it is a goal within reach.

## Next steps
Notes from our participants sharing their next steps will be added here. Check back soon.

This page holds key participant bios and useful links related to the Q&A session on authoring tools. It is also a location to add your comments and continue the conversation. We know we will not have time during the forum to discuss everything of interest. Please use this space to continue the conversation related to authoring and publishing.

## Bios

### Deyan Ginev
Creator of ar5iv.org and LaTeXML developer; W3C Math Working Group member; PhD candidate in hiding (do not disturb).

Deyan's main focus is to enhance the representation of mathematical expressions in rendered research papers, improving their accessibility, computational semantics, and enabling further reuse in a broader class of applications. [Deyan's University Profile](https://kwarc.info/people/dginev/)

### Ulrike Fischer
Member of the LaTeX project.

Ulrike's main focus is currently on LaTeX packages related to accessibility. LaTeX's five year plan will have profound accessibility impacts. [Ulrike's Author Bio](https://www.informit.com/authors/bio/BA672B25-A399-4C25-9AC6-472F5BF29CA2)

### Dr. John Hammersley
Founder of Overleaf; VP Researcher and Community Engagement at Digital Science.

Overleaf is the world's leading LaTeX-based online authoring platform, used by researchers around the world. John's current work focuses on how to best serve the broad research community, with a particular focus on the end user. [John's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-hammersley-6419a266/)

### Dr. Kaveh Bazargan
Director, River Valley Technologies

Kaveh is a physicist, and one of the first to use TeX (1983). In 1988 he founded River Valley Technologies, with the aim of improving the publishing process. Kaveh has a special interest in the accessibility of STM content, and in particular of mathematics. He is a proponent of open standards, and in particular an advocate of XML as the "format of record". [Kaveh's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bazargankaveh/)

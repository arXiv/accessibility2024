          <figcaption>Figure 2. Two stacked bar charts depicting the percentage of overall scores by figure type (top) and the percent description scores by description type (bottom). Each figure may have more than one figure type (e.g., Data Visualization, and Image). N=300</figcaption>

                <h2>Extended description for top chart:</h2>
                  <p>The top chart plots the percentage of each score (0 blank, 1 descriptive, 2 somewhat descriptive, 3 descriptive and 4 very descriptive), for each type of figure (all figures, data visualizations, images, diagrams, text blocks, and tables). Overall around 50% of figure descriptions (considering the alt text and captions together) scored 3 or above, and around 50% of figures scored 2 or below. Of figure types, Data Visualizations receive the highest percentage of 3’s and 4’s followed by images, diagrams, then tables (no 4’s) and text blocks (no 3’s or 4’s). The chart also shows the percentage of figures that contain each element type, and indicates that 33% of figures have a visualization, 47% have an image, 17% have a diagram, 4% have a text block and 6% have a table. Full data table in supplemental material. </p>
                  
                <h2>Extended description for bottom chart:</h2>
                  <p>The bottom chart shows the percentage of descriptions with each score for both overall descriptions, and then broken down by captions, alt text (long field) and alt text (short field). The alt text (long) alone was more likely to receive a high score than the caption alone (51 alt text’s received a 4, and only 16 captions received a 4). In contrast, the alt text short field received a majority of either 0 (161 figures), or 1 (119 figures). Full data table in supplemental material.</p>

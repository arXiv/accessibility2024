The bottom chart shows the percentage of descriptions with each score for both overall descriptions, and then broken down by captions, alt text (long field) and alt text (short field)."

                <h2>Extended description for top chart:</h2>
                  <p>Overall around 50% of figure descriptions (considering the alt text and captions together) scored 3 or above, and around 50% of figures scored 2 or below. Of figure types, Data Visualizations receive the highest percentage of 3’s and 4’s followed by images, diagrams, then tables (no 4’s) and text blocks (no 3’s or 4’s). The chart also shows the percentage of figures that contain each element type, and indicates that 33% of figures have a visualization, 47% have an image, 17% have a diagram, 4% have a text block and 6% have a table.

                  <p>The alt text (long) alone was more likely to receive a high score than the caption alone (51 alt text’s received a 4, and only 16 captions received a 4). In contrast, the alt text short field received a majority of either 0 (161 figures), or 1 (119 figures). Full data table in supplemental material.</p>

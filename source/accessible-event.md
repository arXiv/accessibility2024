#Accessible accommodations at the forum

![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-forum-logo-full-2024.svg){.mkd-img-right .mkd-spacing alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}
We want the accessibility forum to be as accessible as possible and welcome broad participation from the global community. Guided by researchers with disabilities and the requests and feedback from forum participants from last year, we will offer the following accommodations during all events:

## American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation
We will have ASL interpreters at all events, and layer ASL on top of all pre-recorded demos.

## Accessible video captions
All pre-recorded demo videos will have accessible, human-written captions. AI-generated captions cannot handle STEM content. You should see what zoom transcripts do with the words LaTeX and arXiv!

## Live note-taking
Kind volunteers last year offered to take live notes in publicly available documents as a secondary way of following and checking back on discussions. We are [seeking volunteers](#) for this year too. Let us know if you can donate an hour to an event. It is fun and very helpful.

If you have a special accommodation need or further insights into the accommodations above, please let us know in the discussion board below. Learn more about participating in discussions with our [getting started](getting-started.md) guide.

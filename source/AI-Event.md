This session features a demo of two AI-driven tools for accessibility directly from their creators, and a vision-impaired scientist who will provide the perspective of lived experience. Enjoy the demonstrations and stay for a rich discussion of AI tools and how they are benefitting scientists with disabilities today.

This session is for those looking for practical insights into AI's role in accessibility, and hands-on experience with these two tools from academic researchers.

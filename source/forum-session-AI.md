**Fourth-year undergraduate student, James Madison University.**

Allie's research focuses on pairing AI with systems thinking to drive inclusivity in STEM Education. She will share her project that uses AI to explain, interpret and verbalize flow chart visualizations, a common presentation choice in academic research outputs. Analyzing such figures and turning them into words greatly enhances their accessibility for visually impaired academics.

Due to high interest in the forum, and our four-hour time constraint, we have set up discussion boards for each forum topic so that the conversation can continue beyond each session.

The forum discussion boards use Github Discussions and [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus). This open source discussion platform has many benefits, including transparency and being free.

To take part in forum-related discussions you will just need to be logged in to your github account. If you do not have one yet, follow the instructions below to create a free account for the first time.

## Instructions for creating a github account for the first time
1. Go to the [github signup page](https://github.com/signup)
2. Fill in your email and click continue.
3. Either enter a password or click continue accept the auto-generated one.
4. Next, select a username. You are restricted to alphanumeric characters and single hyphens.
5. You will be asked if you want to receive product updates. Input a single 'n' character for no.
6. Lastly, you will be asked to solve a puzzle to verify your account. The default is a visual puzzle, but there is also an option to switch to an audio puzzle.
7. After completing setup, Github will ask you a few questions about your account and, on the next page, to select an account type. Select 'Continue for free' to setup a basic account.
8. When done, you will land on your personal dashboard. You now have a github account!
9. Return to this forum mini-site and navigate to any page. At the bottom you will find the discussion board for that page's topic.

The [arXiv code of conduct](https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/code_of_conduct.html) applies to the forum and discussion boards, including:

> "We expect members of the arXiv community to foster a safe environment for communication of diverse views. All communication between arXiv community members should be respectful."

Due to high interest and time constraints, we have set up discussion boards for each forum topic so that the conversation can continue beyond the sessions.

The discussion boards use github. This open source solution has many benefits, including transparency and being free for all users.

To take part in forum-related discussions you will need to be logged in to your github account. If you do not have one yet, follow the instructions below to create a free account for the first time.

## Instructions for creating a github account for the first time
1. Go to the [github signup page](https://github.com/signup)
2. Fill in your email and click continue.
3. Either enter a password or click continue accept the auto-generated one.
4. Next, select a username. You are restricted to alphanumeric characters and single hyphens.
5. You will be asked if you want to receive product updates. Input a single 'n' character for no.
6. Lastly, you will be asked to solve a puzzle to verify your account. The default is a visual puzzle, but there is also an option to switch to an audio puzzle.
7. After completing setup, Github will ask you a few questions about your account and, on the next page, to select an account type. Select 'Continue for free' to setup a basic account.
8. When done, you will land on your personal dashboard. You now have a github account!
9. Return to this forum mini-site and navigate to any page. At the bottom you will find the discussion board for that page's topic.

The [arXiv code of conduct](https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/code_of_conduct.html) applies to the forum and discussion boards, including:

> "We expect members of the arXiv community to foster a safe environment for communication of diverse views. All communication between arXiv community members should be respectful."

## Discussion
Use this discussion board to ask questions about arXiv's code of conduct or use of the discussion boards themselves.

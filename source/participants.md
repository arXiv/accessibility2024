### Sarah Kane
Ph.D. Candidate in Astrophysics at the Institute of Astronomy, Univeristy of Cambridge.

For Sarah, her career as a researcher is intertwined with her work as a disability advocate. She was born legally blind and has a strong interest in the accessibility of science to people with disabilities. Her work includes usability testing for Astronify, a project of the Space Telescope Institute turning datasets into audio.[Sarah's LinkedIn Profile](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sarah-kane-4a9414220)

### Scott Fleming
Archive Scientist at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), Space Telescope Science Institute (STSI). 

Scott supports missions like GALEX, Kepler, K2, and TESS, spectroscopic data sets across the entire MAST archive. Research-wise, he is interested in open source software development, and new science that is enabled with archival or cross-mission data.[Scott's STSI Profile](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/scott-fleming)

## Navigating an Accessible Research Journey 

### Venkatesh Potluri
Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington.

Venkatesh examines accessibility barriers experienced by blind or visually impaired (BVI) developers participating in professional programming domains such as user interface design, data science, and physical computing. His work contributes real-world systems to improve developer tools and new interaction techniques. [Venkatesh's Homepage](https://venkateshpotluri.me/)

### Dr. Jonathan Godfrey
Senior Lecturer in Statistics, School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences, Massey University.

Jonathan's research is focused on the needs of the thousands of blind people around the world who need additional tools to make the visual elements of statistical thinking and practice less of a barrier.

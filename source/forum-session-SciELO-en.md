  <p>This groundbreaking session on accessibility in the SciELO community is also a first for arXiv: our first non-English event. It will be held only in Spanish and Portuguese with simultaneous translation between those two languages (not English). This session will dig into progress and next steps towards making scientific outputs more accessible in the SciELO community. SciELO is critical open-access publishing infrastructure that serves South America, Spain, Portugal, and more.</p>

## Session resources
- The [SciELO e-book in English](https://25.scielo.org/en/we-so-loved-open-access/){target="_blank"} sheds lights on the ways that SciELO and other individuals from underrepresented regions in the sciences pushed forward open access in global academic communication. This e-book is published as part of SciELO's 25th anniversary celebration, and it is free to download for all.

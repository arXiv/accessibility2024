![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-lockup-forum-bgcolor.png){.mkd-img-right .mkd-border alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}
This page holds key participant bios and useful links related to the Q&A session on long text descriptions for scientific content. It is also a location to add your comments and continue the conversation. We know we will not have time during the forum to discuss everything of interest. Please use this space to continue the conversation related to alternative and long descriptions for scientific images.

## Bios
### Dr. Cynthia Bennett
Senior Research Scientist, Responsible AI and Human Centered Technology, Google.

Cynthia's research involves disabled people as the experts of their own lived experiences, and accessible futures for everyone. [Cynthia's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clb5590/)

### Frank Elavsky
PhD Student, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Data interaction research at Apple; W3C invited expert in Data Visualization in the ARIA Working Group.

Frank's research focuses on methods that improve greater adoption of accessibility practices, engineer tools and systems that improve inclusive practitioner work and outcomes, and critically examine ways that sociotechnical systems exclude people with disabilities.

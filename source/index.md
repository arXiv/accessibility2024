# Welcome to the arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024!
## Exploring the many lines of action that are converging on accessible research

You are warmly invited to our second accessibility forum, an annual event for the scientific community focused on making research more accessible. This year, we spotlight demonstrations and discussions from many different researchers and experts that are all converging on a more accessible future for science.

Learn, share, and be inspired for change. Accessibility means *access regardless of disability*, and only when research is fully accessible can we truly call it open science!

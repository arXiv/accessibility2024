# Welcome to the arXiv Accessibility Forum 2024!
## The many lines of action converging on accessible research

You are warmly invited to our second accessibility forum, an annual event focused on making scientific research more accessible. This year, we spotlight demonstrations and discussions from many different researchers and experts that are all converging on a more accessible future for science.

Learn, share, and be inspired for change. Because only when research is also accessible to people with disabilities can we call it truly "open" science!

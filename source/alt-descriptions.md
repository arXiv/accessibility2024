This session will dig into the critical importance of alt text and descriptions for complex images in scientific papers. We know we will not have time during the forum to discuss everything of interest, please use the [discussion](#discussion) at the bottom of the page to continue the conversation.

## Bios
### Dr. Cynthia Bennett
Senior Research Scientist, Responsible AI and Human Centered Technology, Google.

Cynthia's research involves disabled people as the experts of their own lived experiences, and accessible futures for everyone. [Cynthia's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clb5590/)

### Frank Elavsky
PhD Student, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Data interaction research at Apple; W3C invited expert in Data Visualization in the ARIA Working Group.

Frank's research focuses on methods that improve greater adoption of accessibility practices, engineer tools and systems that improve inclusive practitioner work and outcomes, and critically examine ways that sociotechnical systems exclude people with disabilities.

## Resources
The following resources related to image descriptions and alt text have been shared by our participants and other scholars.

- Shared by Physicist John Gardner, this NSF-funded project will create a software system to [generate accessible STEM content](https://www.slu.edu/news/2022/december/nsf-convergence-accelerator-grant.php).
- Cynthia Bennett has written this excellent [guide to image descriptions and alt text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P62YxEDDfG4DAofnaPiO4Y665eK4rCCD_EwjtF87iBk/edit?usp=sharing).

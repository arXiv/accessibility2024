Join four Open-Source software luminaries to take a peek under the hood of how HTML papers on arXiv are made, what is working, and what comes next. 

This popular and impactful project on arXiv is due to the efforts of multiple people and organizations whose long-standing commitments to accessibility and open-source software made it possible. Get inspired, bring your questions and come ready to engage and gain a deeper understand of what really makes a more accessible research paper.

## Presenter bios
This is in fact a double celebration of open-source software and concrete gains in making scientific research more accessible! The presenters at this event bring a mind-blowing level of combined knowledge on accessible HTML, TeX, and screen reader technology, and all are deeply involved in important open-source software.

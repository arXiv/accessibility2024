![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-forum-logo-full-2024.svg){.mkd-img-right .mkd-spacing alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}
Dear Presenters, we are so excited to collaborate with you on the arXiv Accessibility Forum for 2024! On this page we have gathered together some technical details and some good advice gleaned from presenters this year and last. We hope it is helpful. Please let us know if we should make any updates.

## When to join the webinar
Shamsi will open the room at least 30 minutes early. Interpreters will be joining 15 minutes early. Please join the webinar at least 15 minutes before your session begins for a visual/sound check, and to work through any potential technical surprises.

## Pacing and pauses
- One of the practices that makes an event more accessible for everyone is leaving time for thinking about and absorbing what is being learned. No firehose of information here!
- Moments of silence are healthy and not awkward at all. Let's normalize them.
- Additional pauses are necessary to allow time for interpreters to do their work, including Sign Language interpreters.
- We will take breaks. Usually two, but feel free to call for more if needed.
- Moderators can set expectations at the beginning of the session and let the audience know there will be more pauses, moments of healthy silence, and that we will take breaks.

## Presentation materials
If you reference visual materials such as slides please follow these guidelines:

- Share the files with [Shamsi](mailto:shamsi@arxiv.org) and we will make them available for attendees on the website ahead of time. This is one of the most requested accommodations.
- Describe the information on your screen. Not everyone can see it.
- Allow time for people to look at your screen. This is particularly important for participants who are watching the Sign Language interpreter while you are speaking.
- In the slide deck itself add alt text descriptions to images, charts, and graphs. And when possible, provide links to the underlying data you reference in your materials.
- Say less on each screen and make it big. Use as large a font size as you can.
- Keep backgrounds simple and the contrast high.

## Smart use of screen real estate
At least one Sign Language interpreters will be visible on screen at all times and we would like their videos to be as large as possible. For the larger presenter groups like AI, Deaf Hub, Sonification, and SciELO this could mean taking turns having just some people's screens on at a time. arXiv will have assistants in the background who can help turn screens on an off as moderators or anyone else request it.

## Event length
All sessions ended up being 1.5 hours long. Our ASL interpreters are scheduled in with 15 minutes of padding at the end so that we don't need to cut off an interesting conversation. But we can't go more than 15 minutes over. And don't forget to give Shamsi 2 minutes at the end to thank everyone on arXiv's behalf!

## Have questions or thoughts?
Please reach out to [Shamsi](mailto:shamsi@arxiv.org) anytime!

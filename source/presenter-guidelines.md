Dear Presenters, we are excited to collaborate with you on arXiv Accessibility Forum for 2024! To help you better understand the format and goals of the Forum as well as prepare for your presentation, we hope this page is helpful.


## Presentation structure
Each presentation will consist of a pre-recorded 10-20 minute introductory video, followed by a 40-minute live discussion and Q&A session. We can go over 10 minutes if we need to. 

We hope this format will make the events more relaxing (even fun!) for our presenters. It is challenging to pull off a live demo if the content is to deep dive on a technology. By pre-recording them, we can ensure that mistakes and setup time get edited out and that we can share a concise and accurate edited video of what you want to present.

Pre-recording will also allow us to share content in advance, one of the most requested accessibility-friendly features from last year's feedback. In this way, we hope to expand access and participation in the Q&A sessions.

## Honing your topic
We may have already suggested a direction during email exchanges or brainstorm meetings. As a general guideline, topics should meet as many of these goals as possible:

- Highlight an effort to make the sciences more accessible.
- Elevate the voices of scientists with disabilities.
- Share an existing or new solution or practice.
- Raise awareness of the current state of accessibility in the sciences.

## Recording the videos
The final pre-recorded video will be about 10-20 minutes. Let us know if your video needs more time. We will conduct the recording of the video over Zoom together and take the lead on editing down the raw footage.

Please keep in mind of the following accessibility requests we have received from the attendees. 

- Position your camera in a way that fans or other fast-moving objects are not visible. 
- Use a simple language so that attendees whose first language is not English can better understand the content.
- When speaking, ensure a noise-free environment and stay close to the microphone for better sound quality.Â 

**Hint from a pro:** To preserve continuity between the pre-recorded intro video and the live event, wear the same shirt for both!

## Presentation materials
If your introductory video includes additional materials such as slides, please share with us over Email so we can post them along with the recording with attendees ahead of time. 

To ensure accessibility, consider the following:

- Make them as much screen-reader-accessible as possible.
- For charts and diagrams, repeat information verbally.
- Use a large font size (14 and above reccommended).

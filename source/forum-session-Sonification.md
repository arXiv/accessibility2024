#Sonification: Why Multi-Modal Science is the Future

![Logo for the arXiv forum](../../assets/arxiv-forum-logo-full-2024.svg){.mkd-img-right .mkd-spacing alt='logo for the arXiv forum' role="presentation"}

Join some of the world's leading experts on sonification to go beyond the visual and learn how all our senses can be engaged in exploring and understanding data. This session will demonstrate and discuss how sonification is used across multiple fields including astronomy, statistics, biology and education. Hear from the researchers behind prominent sonification tools how (and why) they use it in their daily work, and why multi-modal scientific outputs are a win for accessibility and the future of science.

This session is for anyone interested in more ways of exploring and understanding data.

# Event format

The Accessibility Forum is an online event hosted over Zoom. It is free and open to anyone.

This year we are testing a more flexible format that we hope will be friendly for both presenters and attendees. Instead of one large event, we will host multiple smaller events spread out over the first two weeks in September.

It gives us more flexibility in the timing. We will not need to cut off any sessions to stick to a strict schedule. We can also schedule events at times that make more sense for everyone's time zone.

Each session will consist of a pre-recorded 10-20 minute introductory video, followed by a 40-minute live discussion and Q&A session. Intro videos, along with presentation materials if any, will be posted below starting from July. 

Last but not least, the forum provides [Github Discussion Boards](https://github.com/arXiv/accessibility2024/discussions){target="_blank"} for general comments and discussions. We look forward to hearing from you.

# Schedule of Events

The Accessibility Forum is an online event hosted over Zoom. It is free and open to all.

This year we are testing a more flexible format that we hope will be friendly for both presenters and attendees. Instead of one large event, we will host multiple smaller events spread out over the first two weeks in September. All events will include a demonstration followed by a discussion and audience Q&A.

More details will appear here as we hone in on exact dates and times, check back often! Below, find a preview of some of the exciting topics that are taking shape.

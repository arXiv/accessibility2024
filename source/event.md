# Schedule of Events

The Accessibility Forum is hosted by arXiv and features researchers and educational institutions working towards making the sciences more accessible. Because if science is not accessible then it is not truly open.

The Forum is an online event hosted over Zoom, free and open to all. Numerous individual events will be held over the first two weeks in September. (Register)[https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eEZ1d27LF2fVM7Y] for some or all!

After hearing from these three brilliant researchers, authors, teachers, learners, thought leaders, and powerful advocates, you will never see disability — or the world around you — in the same way again.

This session is for anyone looking to contribute to and understand their role in creating more inclusive environments where we can all achieve our potential.

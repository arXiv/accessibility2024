Guided by researchers with disabilities and the requests and feedback from forum participants last year, we will offer the following accommodations during all events: Language interpretation We will have American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at all live events with one exception: as of now, our multilingual event with SciELO will feature simultaneous translation in Spanish and Portuguese only. (Do you know Sign Language interpreters who can translate from both spoken Spanish and Portuguese into Portuguese Sign Language or Spanish Sign Language? We would love to connect ) Accessible video captions All video recordings will have accessible, human-written captions (AI-generated captions cannot handle STEM content. You should see what zoom transcripts do with the words LaTeX and arXiv!) Live note-taking Kind volunteers last year offered to take live notes in publicly available documents as a secondary way of following and checking back on discussions. We are seeking volunteers for this year too. Let us know if you can donate an hour or so to an event. It is fun and very helpful. Modeling best practices Our presenters this year want to seize the opportunity of modeling less well known best practices during the events. These include: Sharing as much content as we can in advance. Taking the time to communication clearly, with pauses and breaks for catching up, and normalizing moments of quiet absorption. Describing any visuals shared on screen. Allowing time for guests who speak ASL (a visual language) to absorb other visual content without both signals competing. Remaining flexible and adjusting to needs as they are shared during events. Live Zoom chat will not be enabled during events as it is highly disruptive to screen reader users. Instead, we encourage you to use the discussion boards that will be active on each event page. Seeking CART captioning We are investigating the feasibility of providing CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) captions at the live Forum events. If you or your organization provides this service, or would like to underwrite CART captions for the Forum, we would love to hear from you .

This session will demonstrate and discuss how sonification is used across multiple fields including astronomy, statistics, volcanology, oceanography and education. Hear from the researchers behind prominent sonification tools on how (and why) they use it in their daily work, and why multi-modal scientific outputs are a win for accessibility and the future of science.

We hope this page helps answer your questions about preparation and presenting. Forum schedule This year, instead of one large event we will sprinkle events out across the first two weeks in September. This will allow us to choose dates and times that work with your time zone and other commitments. It will also take the time pressure off of each individual event so we won't feel rushed. Presentation structure Each presentation will consist of two parts: A pre-recorded 10-20 minute introductory video Followed by a live discussion and Q&A session. We hope this format will make the events stress-free and enjoyable for all presenters. It is challenging to pull off a live demo and by pre-recording we can take our time, make mistakes, and edit them out. Pre-recording will also allow us to share content in advance. This is the most requested accessibility accommodation from last year's feedback. It helps to expand access and results in more informed participation in the Q&A sessions. Honing your topic We may have already discussed a direction during email exchanges or brainstorm meetings. As a general guideline, topics should meet as many of these goals as possible: Highlight an effort to make the sciences more accessible. Elevate the voices of scientists with disabilities. Share an existing or new solution or practice. Raise awareness of the current state of accessibility in the sciences. Recording the videos The final pre-recorded video will be about 10-20 minutes, though let us know if your video needs more time. We are flexible. We will conduct the recording of the video over Zoom together and take care of editing and adding captions. Please keep in mind of these top requests that we have heard from attendees. Use clear language and explain any jargon or acronyms you use. Position your camera in a way that fans or other fast-moving objects are not visible. Record from a quiet environment and stay close to the microphone for best sound quality. Hint from a pro: To preserve continuity between the pre-recorded intro video and the live event, wear the same shirt for both! Presentation materials If you reference additional materials such as slides, please share the files with us over email, and we will post them for attendees ahead of time. If you use a slide deck keep the following in mind: When presenting, speak the information on your screen out loud. Not everyone can see your screen. In the slide deck itself add alt text descriptions to images, charts, and graphs. When possible, provide links to the underlying data you reference in your materials. Use as large a font size as you can. Say less on each screen and make it big. Ask questions Please reach out anytime to Shamsi or Miranda with questions!","title":"Guidelines for presenters"},{"location":"presenter-guidelines-pre-event.html#guidelines-for-presenters","text":"Dear Presenters, we are excited to collaborate with you on the arXiv Accessibility Forum for 2024!

No firehose of information here! Moments of silence are healthy and not awkward at all. Let's normalize them. Additional pauses are necessary to allow time for interpreters to do their work, including Sign Language interpreters. We will take breaks. Usually two, but feel free to call for more if needed. Moderators can set expectations at the beginning of the session and let the audience know there will be more pauses, moments of healthy silence, and that we will take breaks. Presentation materials If you reference visual materials such as slides please follow these guidelines: Share the files with Shamsi and we will make them available for attendees on the website ahead of time. This is one of the most requested accommodations. Describe the information on your screen. Not everyone can see it. Allow time for people to look at your screen.

In the slide deck itself add alt text descriptions to images, charts, and graphs. And when possible, provide links to the underlying data you reference in your materials. Say less on each screen and make it big. Use as large a font size as you can. Keep backgrounds simple and the contrast high. Smart use of screen real estate At least one Sign Language interpreters will be visible on screen at all times and we would like their videos to be as large as possible. For the larger presenter groups like AI, Deaf Hub, Sonification, and SciELO this could mean taking turns having just some people's screens on at a time. arXiv will have assistants in the background who can help turn screens on an off as moderators or anyone else request it. Event length All sessions ended up being 1.5 hours long. Our ASL interpreters are scheduled in with 15 minutes of padding at the end so that we don't need to cut off an interesting conversation. But we can't go more than 15 minutes over. And don't forget to give Shamsi 2 minutes at the end to thank everyone on arXiv's behalf! Have questions or thoughts?
